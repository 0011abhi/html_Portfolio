<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Abhimanyu was a legendary warrior prince in the Mahabharata, celebrated for his courage and tragic heroism during the Kurukshetra War.

<p>Early Life and Background</p>
Abhimanyu was the son of Arjuna (the third Pandava) and Subhadra, raised partly in Dwaraka.

He married Uttarā, princess of the Matsya kingdom.

From childhood, he exhibited a deep interest and skill in warfare, absorbing knowledge even from the womb—learning how to enter the invincible Chakravyuha formation, but not how to exit it.

Abhimanyu shone as a fierce and valiant warrior, defeating many notable Kaurava champions.

On the 13th day of battle, with Arjuna distracted elsewhere, Abhimanyu volunteered to breach the Chakravyuha formation to save the Pandavas from defeat.

Only a handful knew how to enter and break this complex formation, and Abhimanyu was among them, though he knew only how to enter, not exit.

After breaking into the formation with unrivaled valor, he was trapped inside as Jayadratha stopped the other Pandavas from following.

Outnumbered, Abhimanyu fought single-handedly against some of the war’s greatest warriors, defeating and injuring many.

Abhimanyu’s Death and Legacy</p>
The Kaurava warriors, unable to defeat him by fair means, broke the Kshatriya code and attacked him together.

After his chariot was destroyed and his weapons broken, Abhimanyu fought with a chariot wheel and bare hands, falling only after a coordinated assault.

His death was a turning point—Arjuna swore vengeance and killed Jayadratha, the main conspirator, the following day.

Abhimanyu’s sacrifice is immortalized as a symbol of youthful bravery and tragic loss.</p>
